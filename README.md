## Hi! I'm Tatiana 🇬🇧
<p>I'm a Frontend developer with a little bit of an artist 🎨</p>
<p>I am dedicated to the design and development of graphical interfaces with Javascript and Angular</p>
<p>I am interested in the world of user experience and how a design influences the way a website or application is used. </br>
<p>I think design is as important as app or web development, since good design facilitates usability, and after all, we create digital products for people to use 👧 👦 👱‍♀️ 👨‍🦱 </p>
<p>I like to work in places where I can contribute doing my bit within a team and learn new technologies and if they are projects with purpose, much better🍃 🌳 🎋 🌍 🐇 🐒 🐘 🐈 </p>
